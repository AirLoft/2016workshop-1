<p>A page can be divided into frames using a special frame document.</p>
<p>The <b>frame</b> tag defines one specific window (frame) within a <b>frameset</b>. Each <b>frame</b> in a frameset can have different attributes, such as border, scrolling, the ability to resize, etc.</p>
<p>The frameset element specifies the number of columns or rows in the frameset, as well as what percentage or number of pixels of space each of them occupies.</p>

<frameset cols="100, 25%, *"></frameset>
<frameset rows="100, 25%, *"></frameset>
