<p>The <b>method attribute</b> specifies the HTTP method (<b>GET</b> or <b>POST</b>) to be used when forms are submitted (see below for description):</p>
<form action="url" method="GET"></form>
<form action="url" method="POST"></form>
<p>When you use <b>GET</b>, the form data will be visible in the page address.</p>
<p>Use <b>POST</b> if the form is updating data, or includes sensitive information (passwords).
POST offers better security because the submitted data is not visible in the page address.</p>
